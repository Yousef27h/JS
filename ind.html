        <p class="paragraphsColor">A number of scientific researchers have been investigating the possible health benefits contained within tea.
            And now it appears there’s a growing body of evidence to suggest that drinking tea could actually ward off
            some very serious conditions, including cancer, obesity and dehydration.

            Studies have suggested that drinking three or more cups of tea a day could actually be better for you than
            drinking the same amount of water, with the antioxidants contained within tea boosting the body’s health, at
            the same time as rehydrating it.

        <li class="listColor">Coffee</li>
        <p class="paragraphsColor">Coffee is one of the world’s most popular beverages.

            Thanks to its high levels of antioxidants and beneficial nutrients, it also seems to be quite healthy.

            Studies show that coffee drinkers have a much lower risk of several serious diseases.
